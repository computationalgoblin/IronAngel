My name is Angel, I’m 25 and I’m from a city called Almeria, in the southeast of Spain. 

I have been working as a tattoo artist for nearly 5 years now.

Also, I have a background in science. I started the psychology degree in university and even though I didn’t finish it, I learned a little bit about working with data and with a scientific framework. The main reason I didn’t complete it is that

I saw a great opportunity in the growing field of data and I thought I could pursue a data scientist career. 

My main interest is AI, I think it is fascinating how it will change our lives and I want to be there. 

I also love to learn, I love to work with people and I’m just so thrived and excited to be here with you all.
